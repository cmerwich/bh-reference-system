    "# Export BH Reference System Features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook exports five new features that enable a student or researcher of Biblical Hebrew (BH) to study its reference system. BH, like other languages, makes use of all kinds of features within the language to establish text-coherence and to ensure that the reader or listener understands to whom or what is being referred to. These BH features are, including their Person, Gender and Number (PGN) properties (if existent) among others: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Personal pronouns, `prps`; \n",
    "* Demonstrative pronouns, `prde`; \n",
    "* The `verb` and its suffix `prs` (if the verb has one); \n",
    "* The suffix `prs` of a word; \n",
    "* `Nouns` that can function as pronouns. I leave these out of consideration, for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within Text Fabric (see: [BHSA](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa)), the dataset this notebook makes use of, named features are already available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features however, are sometimes only available in a transliterated or full BH form (`prps`, `prde`, `prs`). In addition, a combination of multiple other features is needed to determine the PGN property of pronouns, verbs, and suffixes. For example to retrieve the PGN of a verb five seperate features are needed: `pdp`, `nu`, `ps`, `gn` and `prs`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore to make life, research and programming more simple this notebook exports five new features: `pgn_prde`, `pgn_prps`, `pgn_prs`, `pgn_verb`, and `pgn_verb_prs` (i.e. verb+suffix).\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2 of this notebook I will demonstrate some nice things you can do with the new features."
